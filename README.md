# CraftEffects
## Craftable Potions mod for Minecraft

Originally made as a twist for a manhunt that had to be scrapped.
I've added a few effects since then including the Potion of Dirt, and the Potion of Launching.

# Versions

Made for Minecraft 1.21.1
Should work for most versions, although slight changes might need to be made.

# Recipes

All effects follow the same format:

[ x ]
[ b ]
[   ]

x = ingredient
b = glass_bottle
